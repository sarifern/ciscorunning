# Running the project locally

In VSCode, you can use the debugging option, as the .vscode/launch.json has the right runserver arguments.
Manually, the command would be

``` 
python manage.py runserver --settings==ic_marathon_site.local_settings
``` 

# Heroku deployment

Make sure you have the Heroku CLI tool.

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

Login to heroku with the HEROKU_ADMIN and HEROKU_PASSWORD variables

``` 
heroku login
``` 

To set environment variables, use the heroku config command

``` 
heroku config:set <variable name>=############ -a ciscorunning
``` 

Since the app is already configured in Heroku (ciscorunning), there is no further configuration.

Once the changes are committed and push to the repo, Heroku will automatically build the new app and deploy it.
